# Semay Community Moderation Policy

Last updated: February 14, 2026

This policy covers user-generated content in Semay: map pins, business updates, and bulletins.

## In-app controls
- Report content.
- Mute bulletin authors.
- Block unsafe contacts where applicable.

## Enforcement priorities
1. Immediate safety risks (violence, trafficking, explicit threats).
2. Fraud and impersonation.
3. Spam and abusive automation.
4. Clearly illegal content in target distribution regions.

## Enforcement model (MVP)
- Client-side controls are always available.
- Where operator review exists, reported content can be suppressed from default feeds.

## Response targets
- High-risk safety reports: target triage within 24 hours.
- Fraud and spam reports: target triage within 72 hours.

## Appeals and corrections
Request review or correction at: support@semay.app
