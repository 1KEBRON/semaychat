Semay is designed to work with minimal data collection.

## What we collect

## What we do not collect
- No Semay analytics tracking by default.
- No ad-tech identifiers.
- No central Semay account profile with email or phone required for app use.

## How data is stored
- Core app data is stored locally on your device.
- Sync of shared events may happen over BLE mesh and Nostr relays when connectivity is available.
- Optional iCloud backup (if you enable it) stores encrypted private backup artifacts; plaintext seed phrases are not uploaded.

## Payments
- Semay does not custody funds.
- Promise Pay records signed commitments.
- Settlement is completed in external wallet apps.

## Your controls
- You can disable optional iCloud backup at any time.
- You can use report, mute, and block controls for user-generated content.
